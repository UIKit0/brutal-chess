Linux:

To build Brutal Chess on Linux, you will need recent version of SDL, SDL_Image,
and FreeType. SDL 1.2.7 and FreeType 2.1.9 are known to work. The first thing
to do is run ./configure. This should autogenerate a Makefile if you have all
the necassary dependencies installed. If this failed for some reason look at
the output and install any missing libraries. This can sometimes be difficult
to figure out so if you have problems please provide us with feedback so that
we can provide more complete documentation. After you have a Makefile simply
type make and that will build the binary in the src directory.  Finally you can
run 'make install' as root user to install Brutal Chess for all users on the
system. You can delete the build directory after install if you choose to do so.

Note to Debian Users:
Make sure that you have development versions of Xmu and Xi libraries installed
or the autogeneration of the Makefile will fail when trying to verify that you
have SDL installed. On Ubuntu the needed packages are libxmu-dev and libxi-dev.


Windows:

To build Brutal Chess on Windows, Microsoft Visual Studio .NET 2005 is
recommended. Building under other compilers may be possible, but hasn't been
tested. In addition, the FreeType, SDL, and SDL_Image  development libraries
must be installed. Open brutalchess.sln and build Brutal Chess to make the
executable.
